add a (no one) option to the waiting on multi select in task edit because it seems you cannt unselect all trivially.

the people view could be more compact. on XL / large desktop, we can have a 2-column-grid showing the people instead of just one column

Also, we need a delete option for todos... which will obviously need to go through the other entities and look for where it's been linked to and remove those references as well. Alternatively, we remove them on calling those views since we need to iterate over those todos anyway then. That actually makes more sense, when it can't find a todo it should garbage collect and remove the reference.

The columns on the kanban board should scroll horizontally


the timeline view would be cool... let's just do it in a super minimal way. I only have to manage myself for now anyway. let's just do a kind of calendar. The columns are workdays (which are auto-calculated without being stored) and have ... say .... 8 times 4, so 32 rows, each representing 15m. Now it would be cool if you can then drag a task larger . This size can be stored under the calendar data, the todo id and the size in 15m units for that day. does that make sense?


give me some more ideas but I think the next step would be to actually use the app and discover new use cases / bugs then
